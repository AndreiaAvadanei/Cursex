<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m Andreia and I’ve been living in Iasi since 2013.</p>
<p>I'm a sociable person and I easily make friends, but I don't like the first interactions with people. It is essential to know them in order to feel at ease with them.</p>

<div CLASS="Hobbies">

<p>I love a hard hike, but also love the water and I’m happy to spent a day at the beach.
I like to drive, I feel that it is my moment of peace that makes me forget all the problems gathered during the day.</p>
<p>I really like to read, as long as the book has a good story that catches my attention, it doesn't matter who wrote it or when it was written. Sometimes I stay awake until 3-4 in the morning just to read "a few more pages".</p>

        <h1><i>Job</i></h1>

    </div>

<div CLASS="Job">
<p> I’ve worked for two and a half years at BRD where I improve my communication skills due to interactions with the customers. For more than two years now, I am working as a Sr. Compliance Associate at Amazon.</p>
<p> My greatest strengths are analytical thinking and a rigorous self-organization. This allows me to provide fast, accurate & in-depth reports/analysis for large sets of data while also plan and assign high volumes of work to large teams. Furthermore, I can easily train and mentor others on complex matters, motivating people around me to achieve excellent results.</p>
